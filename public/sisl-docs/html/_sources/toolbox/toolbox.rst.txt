Toolboxes
=========

Installing `sisl` will install two packages, `sisl` and `sisl_toolbox`.

The latter are user-contributed tools that are useful for end-users but are
very focused on solving a particular problem. In order to maintain a stable
and sufficiently clean API any `sisl` extensions that are thought to be specialized
would go into the `sisl_toolbox` suite.

Currently these are not heavily documented. We are working on adding the documentations
for the toolboxes.
