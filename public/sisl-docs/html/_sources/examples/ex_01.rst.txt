Graphene tight-binding model
----------------------------

This example creates a minimal graphene unit-cell of two atoms.
The Carbon atoms are described with a single orbital per atom
and with a cutoff radius of 1.42 Ã….

The `Hamiltonian` `H` is an object which may be treated as a sparse
matrix. The `for` loop below loops over all atoms (`ia`) in the graphene
unit-cell. The `close` function returns a list of length `len(R)` with
elements where all neighbouring atoms within the radius defined in `R`
are listed. Comments in the below example clarifies each of the steps
carefully.
