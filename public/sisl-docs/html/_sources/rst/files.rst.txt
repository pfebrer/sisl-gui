File formats
============

sisl implements a generic interface for interacting with many different file
formats. When using the :ref:`command line utilities <toc-scripts>` all these files
are accepted as input for, especially :ref:`script_sdata` while only those which
contains geometries (`Geometry`) may be used with :ref:`script_sgeom`.

In sisl any file is named a `Sile` to allow ``*`` imports.

Please see :ref:`toc-io-supported` for the list of available files.
