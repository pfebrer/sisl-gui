`sgrid`
=======

The `sgrid` executable is a tool for manipulating a simulation grid and transforming
it into CUBE format for plotting 3D data in, *e.g.* VMD or XCrySDen.

Any `Sile` which implements a ``read_grid`` method can be used to post-process data.

For a short help description of the possible uses do:

::

   sgrid --help

Here we list a few of the most frequent used commands.
Note that all commands are available via Python scripts and the `Grid` class.

Creating CUBE files
-------------------

The simplest usage is converting a grid file to CUBE file using

::

    sgrid Rho.grid.nc Rho.cube

which converts a Siesta grid file of the electron density into a corresponding
CUBE file. The CUBE file writeout is implemented in `Cube`.

Conveniently CUBE files can accomodate geometries and species for inclusion in the 3D
plot and this can be added to the file via the ``--geometry`` flag, any geometry format
implemented in `sisl` are also compatible with `sgrid`.

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --geometry RUN.fdf Rho.cube


the shorthand flag for ``-geometry`` is ``-G``.
   
Grid differences
----------------

To easily obtain differences between two grids one may use the ``--diff`` flag which
takes one additional grid file for the difference. I.e.

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc{0} -G RUN.fdf --diff Rho.grid.nc{1} diff_up-down.cube

which takes the difference between the spin up and spin down in the same ``Rho.grid.nc`` file.
The spin (index) specification takes either a single integer or a list of floating point values, as can be
seen in the below and shorter equivalent syntax:

::

   sgrid "Rho.grid.nc{1.,-1.}" -G RUN.fdf diff_up-down.cube

The bracketed specification is an array of the fractions for each spin-component, so here we take the
first spin-component and subtract the second spin-component.
The quotation marks are typically required due to Python's `argparse` module.

Note that these spin specifications *only* work for files that contain **all** spin relevant quantities.

The above is largely equivalent to this small snippet::

  geom = sisl.get_sile('RUN.fdf').read_geometry()
  diff = sisl.get_sile('Rho.grid.nc').read_grid(index=[1, -1])
  diff.set_geometry(geom)
  diff.write('diff_up-down.cube')


Reducing grid sizes
-------------------

Often grids are far too large in that only a small part of the full cell is needed to be studied.
One can remove certain parts of the grid after reading, before writing. This will greatly decrease
the output file *and* greatly speed-up the process as writing huge ASCII files is *extremely* time
consuming. There are two methods for reducing grids:

::

   sgrid <file> --sub <pos|<frac>f> x
   sgrid <file> --remove [+-]<pos|<frac>f> x

This needs an example, say the unit cell is an orthogonal unit-cell with side lengths 10x10x20 Angstrom.
To reduce the cell to a middle square of 5x5x5 Angstrom you can do:

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --sub 2.5:7.5 x --sub 2.5:7.5 y --sub 7.5:12.5 z 5x5x5.cube

note that the order of the reductions are made in the order of appearence. So *two* subsequent sub/remove
commands with the same direction will not yield the same final grid.
The individual commands can be understood via

  - ``--sub 2.5:7.5 x``: keep the grid along the first cell direction above 2.5 Å and below 5 Å.
  - ``--sub 2.5:7.5 y``: keep the grid along the second cell direction above 2.5 Å and below 5 Å.
  - ``--sub 7.5:12.5 z``: keep the grid along the third cell direction above 7.5 Å and below 12.5 Å.

When one is dealing with fractional coordinates is can be convenient to use fractional grid operations.
The length unit for the position is *always* in Ångstrøm, unless an optional **f** is appended which
forces the unit to be in fractional position (must be between 0 and 1).

When combining grid reductions with grid differences the order is also important, the following two
commands are not equivalent:

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --sub 2.5:7.5 x --diff Other.Rho.grid.nc --out test.cube
   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --diff Other.Rho.grid.nc --sub 2.5:7.5 x --out test.cube

where the first command assumes ``Other.Rho.grid.nc`` matches the shape of ``Rho.grid.nc`` *after* it has
been reduced to 5 Ång along the :math:`x` direction. The second assumes the two grids to have the same
shape, then the reduction will be performed on the grid difference.


Averaging and summing
---------------------

Sometimes it is convenient to average or sum grids along cell directions:

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --average x meanx.cube
   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --sum x sumx.cube

which takes the average or the sum along the first cell direction, respectively. Note that this results
in the number of partitions along that direction to be 1 (not all 3D software is capable of reading such a
CUBE file).

If one averages along two directions the resulting grid will be a 1D array and one can save it in a table
with the first column being the remaining dimensions position (in Ång).

::

   sgrid Rho.grid.nc --average x --average y z_charge.dat

will create a two-column data file with :math:`z` coordinate and the plane-averaged charge-density.


Advanced features
-----------------

The above operations are not the limited use of the `sisl` library. However, to accomblish more complex
things you need to manually script the actions using the `Grid` class and the methods available for that method.
For inspiration you can check the `sgrid` executable to see how the commands are used in the script.
